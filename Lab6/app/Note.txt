There are three types of sensors:
    1- Motion sensors:
        These are used to measure acceleration forces and rotational forces along with three axes
    2- Position Sensors:
        These are used to measure the physical position of the device
    3- Environmental sensors:
        These are used to measure the environmental changes like temperature or humidity etc
